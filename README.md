A few quick coorections: Edmontonia seems to have left out in the tip-dated analysis, after re-running it, with Edmontonia included, it still gets left out sometimes, due to yet unexplaine reasons; When inlcuded, it retrieves as a sister taxon to clade formed by 
Euoplocephalus and Pinacosaurus;

One difference was noted between the Thyreophoren tip-dated trees: Using the literature-based dataset, Silvisaurus and Struthiosaurus are retrieved as more closely related to each other than to Sauropelta; With raw PBDB data, Struthiosaurus and Sauropelta are more closely related to 
each other than to Silvisaurus. This details was missed, the author expresses his appologies; However, this does not change the overall conclusions of the case study!
